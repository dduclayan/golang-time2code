Fd returns the integer Unix file descriptor referencing the open file. If f is closed, the file descriptor becomes invalid.
If f is garbage collected, a finalizer may close the file descriptor, making it invalid; see runtime.SetFinalizer for
more information on when a finalizer might be run. On Unix systems this will cause the SetDeadline methods to stop working.
Because file descriptors can be reused, the returned file descriptor may only be closed through the Close method of f,
or by its finalizer during garbage collection. Otherwise, during garbage collection the finalizer may close an
unrelated file descriptor with the same (reused) number.
